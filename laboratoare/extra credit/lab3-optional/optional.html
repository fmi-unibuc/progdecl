As you have seen in the previous section, the Caesar Cipher is not a very safe encryption method.
In this section, security will be upgraded a little.
<h3 class="Heading_20_3"><a id="a__Exercises"><span/></a>Exercises</h3>
<ol start="13">
<li>Write a function <tt>splitEachFive :: String -&gt; [String] </tt>that splits a string into substrings
of length five. Fill out the last part with copies of the character ’X’ to make it as long as the
others.
<pre>
Main&gt; splitEachFive "Secret Message"
["Secre", "t Mes", "sageX"]</pre>
<li>The library function <tt>transpose</tt> switches the rows and columns of a list of lists:
<pre>
Main&gt; transpose ["123","abc","ABC"]
["1aA","2bB", "3cC"]
Main&gt; transpose ["1","22","333"]
["123","23","3"]</pre>
If the rows in a list of lists are of the same length, transposing it twice returns the original
one. Use your <tt>splitEachFive</tt> function to write a <span class="T2">Q</tt>uickCheck property to test this. Also,
show with an example that this is not always the case when the rows are of different lengths.
<li>Write a function <tt>encrypt :: Int -&gt; String -&gt; String</tt> that encrypts a string by first applying the Caesar Cipher, then splitting it into pieces of length five, transposing, and putting
the pieces together as a single string.
<li> Write a function to decrypt messages encrypted in the way above.
<p><b>Hint:</b> The last action of the previous function is to put the transposed list of strings back
together. You will need a helper function to undo this (it is not <tt>splitEachFive</tt>).
</ol>

While the strengthened encryption thwarts a cracker searching for candidate substrings in the cipher-
text, it is of little help against a cracker looking at the cipher-text letter-by-letter. If the cracker
can determine the relationship between a letter and its enciphered counterpart, she can compute the
offset used in enciphering. Now it turns out that in English prose, certain letters are more common
than others, so if we compare the relative frequencies of enciphered letters with those of prose, we
can often determine the Caesar offset. For instance,
<pre>
Main&gt; encypt 12 "Secret Message"
"EFMQYSOQQDEXQEX"</pre>
The most frequent letter in the above cipher-text is ‘Q’. This letter lies 12 places to the right in the
alphabet from the letter ‘E’, and the letter ‘E’ is the most common letter in English prose.
<h3 class="Heading_20_3"><a id="a__Exercises"><span/></a>Exercises</h3>
<ol start="17">
<li> To perform decipherings based on this method,
first write a function
<tt>countFreqs :: String -&gt; [(Char, Int)]</tt> to compute the frequency of each character in
the input string:
<pre>
Main&gt; countFreqs "Secret Message"
[(’S’,1),(’e’,4),(’c’,1),(’r’,1),(’t’,1)
,(’ ’,1),(’M’,1),(’s’,2),(’a’,1),(’g’,1)]</pre>
<li> Next, write a function <tt>freqDecipher :: String -&gt; [String]</tt> which tries to decrypt a
string encrypted using encrypt. It should use <tt>countFreqs</tt> to rank the candidates which
will decipher to ‘E’, from most frequent to least, and then use <tt>decrypt</tt> to produce a ranked
list of potential dicipherings.
<pre>
Main&gt; freqDecipher (encrypt 20 "To be or not to be")
["JERUEHDEJJERUTT","EZMPZCYZEEZMPOO","WREHRUQRWWREHGG"
,"TOBEORNOTTOBEDD",...]
