<h3>Exercises</h3>
<ol start="12">
<li> Define two functions <tt>filterLT</tt> and <tt>filterGT</tt>, such that <tt>filterLT k t</tt> is the tree that results from removing all elements in <tt>t</tt> whose key is greater than <tt>k</tt>. For example:
<pre>*Main&gt; filterLT "0900000000000" testDB
[("0042400212509",("Universal deep-frying pan","pc"))
,("0265090316581",("The Macannihav’nmor Highland Single Malt","75ml bottle"))

*Main&gt; filterLT "0" testDB
[]
</pre>
<p>The function <tt>filterGT k t</tt> is the tree that results from removing all elements in <tt>t</tt> whose key is less than <tt>k</tt>. So:</p>
<pre>
*Main&gt; filterGT "0900000000000" testDB
[("0903900739533",("Bagpipes of Glory","6-CD Box"))
,("9780201342758",
    ("Thompson - \"Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming\"","Book"))]

*Main&gt; filterGT "0" testDB
[("0042400212509",("Universal deep-frying pan","pc"))
,("0265090316581",("The Macannihav’nmor Highland Single Malt","75ml bottle"))
,("0903900739533",("Bagpipes of Glory","6-CD Box"))
,("9780201342758",
    ("Thompson - \"Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming\"","Book"))]
</pre>
<p>We will need these functions for the next part of the exercise.</p>
<li> Define the function <tt>merge</tt>, which takes two trees and produces a single tree of all their elements. Write a suitable <tt>quickCheck</tt> test for your function.
<li> Define the function <tt>del</tt>, which takes a key and a tree, and returns a tree identical to its argument except with any entry for the given key deleted. You will need the function <tt>merge</tt> here.
<li> Define the function <tt>select</tt>, which takes a predicate and a tree, and returns a new tree that contains only entries where the value satisfies the predicate.
